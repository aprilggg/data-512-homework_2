# Considering Bias in Data

## Goal
The objective of this project is to investigate the presence of bias in data, particularly in Wikipedia articles, focusing on articles about cities in various states of the United States. Through the amalgamation of a dataset containing Wikipedia articles and another dataset containing state populations, you will utilize the ORES machine learning service to gauge the quality of these city-based articles.

The task involves conducting an in-depth analysis of the representation of US cities on Wikipedia and the discrepancies in the quality of articles across different states. The analysis should be presented through a comprehensive set of tables showcasing the following information:

1. A comparison of the states with the most and least coverage of cities on Wikipedia relative to their respective populations.

2. Identification of the states with the highest and lowest proportion of high-quality articles about cities.

3. A ranking of US geographical regions based on articles per person and the proportion of high-quality articles.
